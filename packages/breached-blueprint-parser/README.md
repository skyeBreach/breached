Breached-Blueprint is a templating, and turbo-repo management package designed to allow developers to easily manage and create new packages. Along with Blueprints ability to manage packages it is also designed to track and run developer designed scripts. This package is intended to be easy to customise using a flat config system and is extensible with external plugins.

Whilst there are similar plugins such as Turbo-Gen, Plop, and Hygen; Breached-Blueprint was designed to allow for developers to easily customise and extend it. Blueprint primarily uses plop for its templating, but is not just a plop wrapper and adds many more features to the templating systems.
